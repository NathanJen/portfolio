        <p>
          Iâ€™m a Designer and Devloper and currently pursuing a Master of HCI at CMU. I also just recently 
          graduated from CMU with a degree in Information Systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I donâ€™t consider myself a designer in the traditional sense, I constantly strive to solve 
          problems and giving people joy. This desire coupled with my passion for technology means that I 
          dream to deliver people joy by designing meaninful experiences that use technology to solve very 
          real problems. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school and work, I am a huge fan of movies, video games, and LA sports ðŸ¤“!

  return (

      <h6>Lets Talk! â˜Ž</h6>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m always looking to meet new people so I can become a better designer by continuing to learn 
        new perspectives, while also hopefully imparting knowledge that I am so greateful and lucky to have.
