                For the 2020 CMU-IFF festival, I am serving as the webmaster. You can see 
                the current deployed website at: https://www.cmu.edu/faces/.

            <TextBlock title="The Problem">
              <p>
                The website acts as the primary source of information for The Carnegie Mellon 
                International Film Festival (CMU-IFF). Thus, the CMU-IFF website needs to have 
                a good UX/UI to promote awareness about the events and help facilitate the 
                purchase of tickets. 
              </p>
            </TextBlock>
          </section>
          <section id="goals" ref={ref2}>
            <h6>Goals</h6>
            <TextBlock title="Respnsiveness + Intuitive Navigation">
              <p>
                The current website is unresponsive, overloaded with information, and oversaturated with navigable tabs. 
                This is especially problematic as more people continuously access websites on mobile devices, and the 
                CMU-IFF attracts an older audience.

            <h6>Implementation</h6>
            <TextBlock title="Description">
              <p>
                This website is created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All the film information is stored in a JSON file, 
                which then gets dynamically rendered into the HTML page through Javascript. The live site can be viewed here 
                at: cmu.edu/faces
              </p>
            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock title="Next Steps?">
              <p>
                While I made the decision to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure that this website can be updated and 
                maintained by more people, looking back, I think that it wouldâ€™ve been worth it to implement this website 
                with React. There are a lot of template pages, so code modularization though React Components would have 
                been especially useful for development time and quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, this website does not have the best performance and I would like to see whether the performance 
                can be optimized through code splitting.
